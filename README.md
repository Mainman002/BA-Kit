# BA-Kit
BGE Blender Asset Kit. a game to make games
This is a mix of files to help in making blender games. It includes a fps style character, 2.5D platformer character,
2d platform character, teleporters, enemies, collectables, and many more items found in most games! this kit is not 
designed to be super pretty (so you can have fun adding your own graphics) but there are some objects that look kind
of cool. most of the game uses logic bricks and others parts use python scripts (blenders default script language)
I look forward to seeing all the cool things you guys will make in BA Kit! and if there is something that you would
like me to add please let me know and I will see what I can do!
